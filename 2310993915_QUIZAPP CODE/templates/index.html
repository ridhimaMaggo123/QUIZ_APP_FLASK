  <p>My name is Ridhima and I am a passionate developer. Welcome to my quiz website!</p>

<div class="row">
  <p>Here, students have the opportunity to contribute their own questions and challenge other students. I believe that learning is not limited to textbooks, and by creating this platform, I aim to foster a collaborative and engaging environment for students to expand their knowledge. With the ability to add questions and participate in quizzes, students can actively participate in the learning process and test their understanding of various subjects.</p>

  <p>Happy quizzing!</p>
